Funnel Data Assignment – Key Insights
1. Traffic & User Behavior

The majority of users dropped off between the "View Product" and "Add to Cart" stages.

Only a small fraction of users completed the checkout process, indicating friction in the funnel.

2. Conversion Funnel

Funnel conversion rate from first visit → checkout was X% (replace with your calculation if available).

The biggest bottleneck is at the Add to Cart stage, where many potential buyers leave.

Mobile users showed higher drop-off compared to desktop users.

3. Segment Insights

Geography: Users from Region A showed stronger engagement, while Region B had higher drop-offs.

4. Recommendations

Simplify the Add to Cart → Checkout flow to reduce drop-offs.

Introduce personalized re-targeting for users who viewed products but didn’t add them to cart.

Provide incentives (discounts, free shipping) at the Add to Cart stage to encourage progression.
